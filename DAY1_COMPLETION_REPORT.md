## 🚀 Next Steps (Day 2+)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Fix Chrome Extension Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Remove problematic packages, use stable alternatives
   npm install --save-dev jest puppeteer @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```

2. **Create v2 Module Stubs**
   ```
   src/mkd_v2/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── core/
   │   ├── message_broker.py
   │   └── session_manager.py
   └── platform/
       ├── detector.py
       └── base.py
   ```

3. **Implement Basic CI/CD**
   ```
   .github/workflows/test.yml  # GitHub Actions for automated testing
   ```

### Week 1 Goals
- [ ] All Day 1 tests passing at 100%
- [ ] Basic v2 architecture modules implemented
- [ ] Chrome extension-native host communication working
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational

## 💡 Key Learnings & Insights

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive Planning** - The detailed Day 1 plan provided clear direction
2. **Fixture-Based Testing** - Global fixtures make tests more maintainable
3. **Modular Test Structure** - Separation by component type is working well
4. **Documentation-Driven Development** - Having clear specs helps implementation

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Module Dependencies** - v2 modules don't exist yet (expected)
2. **Chrome Extension Testing** - Browser environment mocking is complex
3. **Package Dependencies** - Some npm packages have compatibility issues

### Recommendations for Day 2
1. **Start with Module Stubs** - Create basic v2 module structure first
2. **Iterative Testing** - Get one module fully tested before moving to next
3. **Simplify Dependencies** - Use minimal, stable packages for Chrome testing
4. **Focus on Core Functionality** - Message broker and platform detection first
