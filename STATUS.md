# Development Status

## Current Status: Week 3 Phase 3 Complete - Web Enhancement

We have successfully completed Week 3 Phase 3: Web Enhancement. The MKD Automation Platform v2.0 now includes comprehensive web automation capabilities with advanced browser integration and DOM manipulation.

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

**Week 3 Phase 1: Core Intelligence (Previously Completed)**
- Context detection and analysis system
- Smart recording with pattern recognition  
- Intelligent automation decision engine
- Achieved 75% suite success rate

**Week 3 Phase 2: Advanced Playback Features (Previously Completed)**
- **Context Verification System**: Pre-execution environment validation with multiple strictness levels
- **Adaptive Execution Engine**: Smart action adaptation when UI elements change or move
- **Error Recovery Mechanisms**: Intelligent failure detection and recovery with learning capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Real-time performance monitoring with adaptive optimizations
- **Unified Playback Engine**: Integration layer combining all advanced features

**Week 3 Phase 3: Web Enhancement (Just Completed)**
- **DOM Inspector & Manipulator**: Advanced element detection with multiple strategies (CSS, XPath, text, attributes, visual position, AI semantic)
- **Browser Controller**: Multi-tab coordination system with cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **JavaScript Injection System**: Dynamic script injection with security sandboxing and performance monitoring
- **Web Automation Engine**: Unified web automation system with multiple interaction modes (Standard, Stealth, Performance, Reliable, Hybrid)

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Completed

- **Smart Error Recovery**: Multiple recovery strategies with learning from failures  
- **Performance Optimization**: Real-time monitoring with adaptive batch processing
- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Standard, Safe, Fast, Adaptive, and Recovery modes

**Web Automation Features**:
- **Multi-Strategy Element Detection**: CSS selectors, XPath, text content, attributes, visual position, and AI semantic matching
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge with unified API
- **Advanced Tab Management**: Multi-tab coordination, tab grouping, and cross-tab actions
- **Secure Script Injection**: Sandboxed JavaScript execution with built-in automation utilities
- **Intelligent Interaction Modes**: Stealth, Performance, Reliable, and Hybrid modes for different use cases

## Next Steps

The next logical progression would be **Week 3 Phase 4: Media & Analytics** to add video capture integration and analytics collection, or moving to **Week 4: Platform Integration and Testing** for comprehensive system integration and testing.
