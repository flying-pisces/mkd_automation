## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Components Added

#### 1. **LiveEventsWindow Class**
```python
class LiveEventsWindow:
    """Optional live events display window during recording."""
    
    def show(self):
        # Position in bottom-right corner
        # Always on top
        # Real-time event streaming
    
    def add_event(self, event_text):
        # Timestamped event logging
        # Auto-scroll to latest
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Settings**
```python
self.show_live_events = tk.BooleanVar(value=False)
# Added checkbox: "Show Live Events Window"
```

#### 3. **Modified Recording Flow**
```python
def start_recording(self):
    # Hide main window completely
    self.root.withdraw()  # Changed from iconify()
    
    # Show stopwatch
    self.stopwatch.show()
    
    # Optionally show live events
    if self.show_live_events.get():
        self.live_events_window.show()

def stop_recording_internal(self):
    # Close all recording windows
    self.stopwatch.close()
    self.live_events_window.close()
    
    # Restore main window
    self.root.deiconify()
```
