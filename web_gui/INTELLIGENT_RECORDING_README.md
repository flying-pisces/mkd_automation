# üß† MKD Intelligent System-Level Recording

## Overview

The MKD Automation Web GUI now includes **intelligent system-level monitoring** that goes far beyond simple mouse and keyboard recording. This advanced system monitors and correlates **three distinct layers** of user activity:

### üéØ Three-Layer Architecture

1. **üñ±Ô∏è Input Layer**: Mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input with precise timing
2. **üìπ Visual Layer**: Screen recording/screenshots of what the user sees  
3. **üîß System Layer**: Process launches, window changes, Task Manager integration, semantic analysis

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîç **Intelligent Process Monitoring**
- **Real-time process tracking**: Monitors all process creation/termination
- **Application identification**: Recognizes browsers, calculators, text editors, etc.
- **Window focus tracking**: Knows which application the user is actively using
- **Parent-child relationships**: Understands how processes spawn other processes

### üß† **Semantic Action Analysis** 
- **Hotkey recognition**: Understands Ctrl+Alt+Del, Ctrl+Shift+Esc, Win+R, etc.
- **Context-aware actions**: Knows when you're opening a browser vs. calculator
- **Intent inference**: "User opened Calculator for calculations" vs. "User launched browser"
- **Application-specific behaviors**: Detects private browsing, file operations, etc.

### üîß **Task Manager Integration**
- **Auto-launch**: Automatically opens Task Manager during recording for system visibility
- **Process correlation**: Links user actions to system process changes
- **Resource monitoring**: Tracks CPU/memory usage during recording sessions
- **System impact analysis**: Understands how user actions affect system performance

### üé¨ **Intelligent Replay**
- **Multi-layer playback**: Shows video + user actions + system events simultaneously  
- **Semantic annotations**: Displays high-level meaning of user actions
- **Process timeline**: Shows what applications were launched when
- **Correlation visualization**: Links user inputs to system responses

## üöÄ How It Works

### Recording Phase
1. **User starts recording** ‚Üí System monitoring begins
2. **Task Manager auto-launches** ‚Üí Provides system visibility
3. **Three monitoring streams activate**:
   - Input capture (mouse/keyboard)
   - Screen capture (video/screenshots)  
   - System monitoring (processes/windows)
4. **Real-time correlation** ‚Üí Actions linked to system events
5. **Semantic analysis** ‚Üí Meaning extracted from low-level actions

### Analysis Phase
- **Process events**: "chrome.exe launched" ‚Üí "User opened web browser"  
- **Window changes**: "Focus changed to Calculator" ‚Üí "User switched to calculations"
- **Hotkey detection**: "Ctrl+Shift+Esc pressed" ‚Üí "User opened Task Manager"
- **Application context**: "Typing in calc.exe" ‚Üí "User performing calculations"

### Replay Phase
- **Video playback** with action overlays
- **Process timeline** showing application launches
- **Semantic annotations** explaining user intent
- **System impact visualization** showing resource usage

- **Event Correlation**: Links user actions to system events within time windows
- **Semantic Analysis**: Converts low-level events to high-level meanings

### Enhanced Backend (`backend_server.py`)  
- **Async WebSocket Server**: Handles real-time communication
- **Multi-stream Recording**: Coordinates video, input, and system monitoring
- **Task Manager Control**: Programmatically launches and manages Task Manager
- **Data Correlation**: Links user actions with system events

### Intelligent UI (`test_intelligent_recording.html`)
- **Live System Dashboard**: Real-time CPU, memory, process monitoring
- **Correlation Visualization**: Shows user action ‚Üí system response pairs
- **Process Management**: Live process list with resource usage
- **Event Stream**: Real-time log of all three monitoring layers

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Browser Launch Detection
```
User Action:    Win+R ‚Üí type "chrome" ‚Üí Enter
System Event:   chrome.exe process created (PID: 1234)
Semantic Result: "User launched Chrome web browser"
Recording:      Video shows Run dialog + process launch
```

### Example 2: Calculator Usage
```  
User Action:    Win+R ‚Üí type "calc" ‚Üí Enter ‚Üí "123 + 456 ="
System Event:   calc.exe process created ‚Üí window focused
Semantic Result: "User opened Calculator and performed arithmetic"
Recording:      Video + keystrokes + process correlation
```

### Example 3: Task Manager Hotkey
```
User Action:    Ctrl+Shift+Esc
System Event:   taskmgr.exe process created
Semantic Result: "User opened Task Manager via hotkey"
Recording:      Hotkey detection + process launch + video
```
